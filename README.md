# Dummy App For Testing

This is app is meant to be a tool to use in jobs interviews, so a tester candidate can show his/her skills.
Thus it contains _intentional bugs_ that a tester should find.
It also allows a candidate to show automation skills.
As background information, the candidate will be told that this app uses an API _behind the scenes_, so the candidate can talk about integration testing streategies and approaches.
It will be deployed as a Heroku App.
